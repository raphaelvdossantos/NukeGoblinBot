## About Nuke
This is Nuke, a Goblin bot for Discord servers.
Nuke is a helpful, friendly, goblin companion for D&D 5e adventures. He can help you in your adventures by quickly providing access to many DnD assets such as spells and... just spells at the moment, and a fumble generator - because of course -, and spin some dice.

But fret not, Goblin is a quick learner and will soon be able to help you with so much more.

## How does it (kinda) work

Nuke has - or will have at some point in the future - memorized all the knowledge provided by the [DnD5e API](https://www.dnd5eapi.co), which has several DND, assets useful for any gameplay.

Firstly it needs you need to be added to your Discord server (we are still working on this part).

With that done, you can ask Nuke for a list of his services by typing `/help` in any of the channels to which he has access.

From that point just follow whatever the help guide tells you to and pray for the best ðŸ˜„

## Technology

Nuke was written in Python - even though he hates snakes, or anything poisonous or full of dangerous pointy teeth, or anything that can kill stuff really.

He was recruited by a mad Wizard that had no other choice but to use Python to write down his instructions... And that's it.
The Wizard hopes he will be able to help become a better Goblin and assistant in the future, but right now this is all he - and everyone else - got.
